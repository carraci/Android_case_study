**Developmental Models**: Android follows an open-source development model, which means that anyone can contribute to its development. The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is the primary source for Android development. It provides the source code, documentation, and tools required to build Android-based systems. Developers can modify the code, add new features, and create custom versions of Android².

**Licensing**: Android is licensed under the Apache License 2.0². This license allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute Android without any restrictions. It also ensures that any modifications made to the original source code are shared with the community.

**Modes of Funding**: There are various modes of funding for Android development. Some companies generate revenue by offering additional features or services on top of the open-source Android platform. For example, they may provide enterprise-grade features, performance enhancements, legal protection, or professional support¹. Other companies may offer Android-based products or services and generate revenue through sales or subscriptions.

**Commercial and Non-Commercial Use**: Android can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Many companies use Android as a platform to develop and sell their own products or services. Additionally, individuals and organizations can use Android for personal projects or non-profit initiatives without any licensing fees or restrictions².
